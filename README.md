# DaChip8JS [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/DanTup/DaChip8JS?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DanTup/dachip8js)

An attempt to make [my CHIP-8 interpreter written in C#](https://github.com/DanTup/DaChip8) run in the browser using [Bridge.NET](http://bridge.net/).

## ROMs

For testing, I am using the Chip-8 Pack downloaded from [chip8.com](http://www.chip8.com/?page=109). These ROMs are not committed to the repo, so you will need to download and extract them into ROMs/Chip-8 Pack to run.
