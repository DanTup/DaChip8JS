# DaChip8JS [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/DanTup/DaChip8JS?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DanTup/dachip8js)

DaChip8JS is my [C# CHIP-8 interpreter](https://github.com/DanTup/DaChip8) running in the browser using Bridge.NET.

## ROMs

For testing, I am using the Chip-8 Pack downloaded from [chip8.com](http://www.chip8.com/?page=109). These ROMs are not committed to the repo, so you will need to download and extract them into `HTML/ROMs/Chip-8 Pack` to run.

## Demo

Here's a short video showing `Breakout (Brix hack) [David Winter, 1997].ch8` from the Chip-8 pack. I believe the flickering is part of the game, and not my fault! This works basically the same as the C# version (albeit consuming far more resources currently).
